For open quantum system I highly recommended the mentioned links 
1. https://qsm.quantumtinkerer.tudelft.nl/1_basics_of_noise/  
(This one is very helpful with hands on approach (considering my background) with some googling) 
2. https://matteoacrossi.github.io/oqs-jupyterbook/index.html (Using Qiskit) 
3. https://wiki.helsinki.fi/display/mathphys/TCM315+Fall+2020+%28Aalto+PHYS-E0542%29%3A+Open+Quantum+Systems
